This is first mini-project for semantic-web class.

Steps for this project:
1. Create RDF graph with ~15 selected triples.
2. Create a container.
3. Create a collection.
4. Add the XSD datatypes - 4 different datatypes (ex. boolean, string, numeric, date).
5. Answer the questions:
    How are containers represented in the graph?
    How are collections represented in the graph?
    How are the datatypes presented?
    Does the visualization as a whole mirror your earlier hand-drawn graph?
6. Modify your RDF document using the properties from dictionaries.
7. Define classes of items in your database.
8. Add the rdf:type statements.
9. Describe each property that is not defined in external dictionaries using RDF Schema.
10. Use each of those:  rdfs:label, rdfs:seeAlso, rdfs:isDefinedBy, rdfs:seeAlso, rdfs:comment.
11. Prepare two queries for your graph that extract some interesting information
